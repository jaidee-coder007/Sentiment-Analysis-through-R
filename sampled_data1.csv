Very good services,"A bank under the Government of abcd, abc bank. People who pay low interest and long repayment and provide various types of loans, term loans and investment can open an account for the first time, and I would enjoy doing abc bank.I finished the day with the procedures in the open. Used by the atm card and withdraw money from the account would not be able to perform online transactions ."
Wake up customer care service people.,"Uptil now I was in a false claim that abc bank is better than other banks in its services but, I was totally wrong.My experience with bank is wrost and horrible.Guys abc bank customer care numbers 1800 102 1111 and 1800 22 1111 if you ard abc bank customers try to call on these numbers all the time they are busy and no one pick up the call.I have been trying for more than two days and no one is answering.If some is having urgent need of money and unfortunately if don`t get response from this so called abc bank who will take responsibilty of his concerns.I know abc bank have large customer base but this not the excuse you can give all the time.If someone want to open abc bank account do take note above things.Thank you."
Unecessary charges,"Hi,

I am the account holder of abc bank from past 3 years. abc bank deducts the charges which has to be free like SMS charges,Cash deposit charges. abc bank doesn't have proper customer charges.I calculated the amount which abc bank charged me is more than 2000 from past 3 years. There is no dedicated line to contact them due to high call flow. abc bank is one the biggest bank of abcd so it should take of their customers."
abc bank,abc bank all employees is very very good service provided to all us. My last 4 years accounts in this bank. My banking all usse whatever problem Very help all abc bank employees. My all friends circle and my all family members savings accounts for these banks because is a bang really helpfully people's that's any personal problems creating. My trajectories and my banking problems and also not working atm cards I am my banking employer because hi is currently customer support banker. So my dear all friends you're joining the abcdns great employee bank Really nice people abc bank.
abc bank SLOW WORKING BANK,abc bank is a good and trusted bank among all other bank. It is fully controlled by Govt of abcd. The salary of abc bank employee is very good. The dealings with customer comparing other banks are very poor.Due to this factor now the customer are going to private bank.there is more for processing time in abc bank comparing to others bank. Due to this type waste of time there are huge mass not intrested to go with abc bank. In this era time is money or money is time.My advice to govt plz moniter all the working of govt organisation including man. By proper monitering efficient work and good dealings with customer there must be increase in banking business for abc bank.
Slowest and non productive bank,"OMG one of the biggest mistake of my life, I opened a savings account when I was minor now when I turned major they took about 11months to issue my ATM card.ok alright than they took about 1month to activate my account.I have worst branch of abc bank were there are 5 cashiers counter but only 1 of them counter is opened and all are closed since I was 17years old( now I m 21) .Simply go to IDBI or ICICI.

"
INTERNET banking,I think abc bank is good all about like saving current account provide intrest rate very good by 1 thing is very bad as compare to other bank in netbanking section because for net banking visit abc bank and submit to bank and other bank as online we can use netbanking without any paper work . That over all good services are very good. abc bank has to improve less paper work and digitalize .
Smart bank,abc bank is very nice bank.there are many branches in all over abcd that why this bank is so popular .all the employees of this bank is so smart.w e can easily transfer money with net banking at anywhere 24?7hour.this bank is a part of goverment bank.this bank gives a intrest on bank money to consumer.this intrest is big comparing to the other banks intrest.we can also easily approved our home loan .business loan and other student loan with low intrest.so thats ehy we can easily say that this bank is smart bank
abcd's most trusted bank,The government is making people about the financial institutions to meet their financial needs. abc bank stands for abc bank it is d only bank which has d reputation of most trusted and valued banks among all by the government of abcd.it has branches in almost allmost over in abcd . The apps of abc bank make people use this banks facility at its exent. I m a user of abc bank nd I m mesmerized with its facilities thnq.
Esteemed Banking Services?,"It is always been a privilege to say that I worked in abc bank. As far as the brand name is considered it is the best of all the banks . Incentives and other allowances are the best of all other banks . Bank staff is cooperative and a boon to learn a lot about banking, particularly General banking. But when it comes to work load, it is always full of customers and no chance of taking rest in between. once you started the BOD you have to work without any exception till they work is completed at the evening. Quite hectic wotk but satisfied as I am delivering services to the public. proud of abc bank"

Unsatisfactory support by abc bank,"Hi friends, I am using this abc bank from last 5 years and salary and benefits of the abc bank customers is more and the job security is also more because it is a government bank, and the job holders don't help the customers of the bank in a proper manner, and the customers struggles a lot in bank. The career growth is more for the government job holders and they are arrogant and they are not at all patient in explaining details to the customers.

The work environment is luxury and don't work in a proper manner, and private banks works in a better than these banks, and CEO rating is high

abc bank has high number of employees, many awards and recognitions are given to the abc bank for its performance and apps came to existence for easy transaction, and the apps like abc bank Buddy came to know the amount of their account and to pay the electricity bill and other bills easily"

I was daily go for it but there are so many people in the que and I was waiting for my turn. Everyday I was failed to exchange my note. It feels very bad at that time as que was countless and currency was limited in banks. Finally I entered in bank and there found also another que. It is very bad experience for me.

If every branches work with full force then none other bamk will stand in front of this bank"
Account not transferred after many tries,"I am having a account in abc bank Bhubaneswar since April 2011. I was in Bhubaneswar for several years but now I moved on to Bangalore. Now the problem I am facing is I want to have my account transferred to Bangalore. I applied several times in abc bank Bangalore , filled the form and handed it over to abc bank. But even after 3-4 times my account didn't get transferred to Bangalore. They said the sign mismatched( as it is a very old and my first account and also I didn't have cheque book facility, so I didn't often used sign on that account) . I am showing all my original documents over here in Bangalore abc bank to take a look at my signature which I used to open the account but I didn't get to see it. They asked me to fly to home branch and apply for transfer from Bhubaneswar but as I am working as an intern I am not liable for any holidays. I asked to close the account and again I got the same reply that you can close the account from Bhubaneswar . Now what should I do. I don't have enough money for flight nor can I afford any leave. The employees are not cooperating at all. Recently I also transferred my ICICI Bank account and without any problem I got to see the signature as well as got the account transferred within 15 days. abc bank lost my faith in them. They should do something to figure this out ."

Very bad service,"abc bank is a very reputed bank of abcd . The most of the branches of banks in allover abcd of this bank ( abc bank) . But instead of it the employers doesn't mean anything to the customers service. They even doesn't talk with the customers softly. I was also and work in that bank before some days .

I go for a cheque work I mean I want to transfer the cheques money to my account and that was my first time in which I have a work of cheques. So I was not any knowledge about cheques . So I was working after advising some people Working in same bank at small posts .

They tell me that fill the form and staple that form with the cheque and put into the box. I did the same . After waiting 3 working days I think that money isn't transfer till now . Then I go to the branch and tell my problem then a lady worker told me that I have to so much work today so please come tomorrow and I was so frustrated and come to the home. Then next day I went again in the branch and go to madam but security guard said that madam come after 12 so come after 12 . I was so irritated but I can't do anything. I go after 12 and there I tell that lady worker about my problem again and she said that you have to wait for some time and then I again go to that madam and then she give my cheque to me and said that signature are not same . I was so irritated that if this was the result then why I came here 3 times . But I haven't have to do anything instead to go home. And then I come to my home and telling others about abc bank's employees work. I am so frustrated after this ."
Going down,abc bank ( abc bank) bank is a public sector bank and it's mostly people using bank and more over thousands of employees are working in abc banks to give service to the public in terms of money and it's highly reputated bank in abcd but know the bank is not maintaining the customer service satisfaction because the employees working in the branches of abc bank they are not not responding quick customer problems of accounts and cheques and so many issues they are very slow and they don't come to bank in time and the is no proper rules and regulations to them and they simple take their salaries in time and they don't come in time to bank and they don't respond to customers problems in time and they don't tell clearly and they are simply irritate customers with their lazy attitude and it's slowly loosing it's reputation and finally it's a worst customer service bank.

"abc bank, The name its self say everything","abc bank abcd largest government bank under RBI. This bank help to improve the ecenomy of abcd. It has several branches in abcd. Now a day because of notebandi, abc bank play a vital role to improve ecenomy. Several others bank have link with this bank. It provide several facilities to its customer. Online banking, buddy app and others app have been provided by this bank. RBI gave 1 st priority to abc bank for implementation of services to customer. No doubt abc bank is a good branch in abcd since more than 100 yrs and it give a good service to its customer.

abc bank The Nation's Bank with A service to Talk About,"I have been a customer of abc bank for a Long time. The Bank has a vast network of Branche and ATMs all over the country. It employs a large part of the country and has a emotional connect too.

The abc bank offer great Salary and benefits to it's employees and gives job security too.

Career growth is great, people can become managers and enjoy alot of perks. The work environment is good and not very much hectic.

CEO is Arundhati Bhattacharya a very competent and knowledgeable.

The only thing the bank lacks according to me is the service part to it's customers. But, we have to consider that abc bank has a very large customer base and it's a bank to every abcdn Rich or Poor, so they have big pressure and catering to each customer is difficult but not impossible. Sometimes due to being a govt. undertaking the managers behave rudely to it's customers.

It is considered safe as it is a nationalised bank. The minimum balance required for savings account is also very less, it's INR 1000 to 0 in most accounts.

All in all it's a nice bank to be associated with but you won't find much personalised banking other than in it's Kohinoor branches.

Thanks for reading my review.

Please like and comment.

A VERY GOOD AND TRUSTED BANK,"abc bank is the very good bank . the services of the bank is very good the management of the bank is awesome the employees of the bank talks very respectively and knows the problems of customers . we can easily send or pay money online every where . also the ecorner is great all the machines are present their for instant work ATM{ automated teller machine ], CDM [ cash deposit machine ], PUM{ passbook updation machine ], CHDM [ cheque deposit machine ] all the machines work properly and saves allot of time . abc bankis great ."
Work Ethics not maintain,"Hi as per my personal experience with abc bank lower parel branch. whenever I went to branch no one can attend for query related to saving account. seance 02/11/2016 at morning 11.30 am I reached branch for forget net banking password correction. but who is attending this query thous person not come at duty time. and when I asked to Clint service executive for related this matter. they had also told me to wait, when counter person will come then your query will solve. He was come at 12:30 pm. so I recommend to all please do not create your saving account in abc bank. you can create your account in other privet bank also."
Rudly Behaviour,"My name is sunny from . I have an account in abc bank since from 2016 bt I didn't saw a staff like mr. Deuri he dont have any manner to

Talk . not even know how to behave with customer . sir I think we are a customer not beggar . abc bank always says that it is only becoz of customer we are at this position . bt I really sorry to say you that abc bank jairampur is not working properly. Only to open a joint account they are still taking 6 months .dont you think it is too much? Even forms are not available.

Really Great Services,"There is no compitition of abc bank services whether it is net banking, mobile banking or CDM. I have been customer of abc bank since last 8Yrs. They provide great banking services. Cash Deposit Machine is awesome. You do not need to wait for opening of bank to deposit cash. E-Corner is a great option. You can print your passbook as well. It was yesterday only when the currency of 500, 1000 was declared to be invalid from today. As the CDM was works 24* 7 people deposited their notes yesterday in CDM. So personally I think no other bank provide such a great fascilities.

"
abc bank,abc bank is very slow working bank. many employee of the bang did not work carefully.many time the internet banking not work watching a server problem .when you drop the cheque in bank then one week later clear the cheque . so people is many problem for this slow working.abc bank provide many places atm but many of atm not working. abc bank only for goverment employee bank because only for government employee loan provide for tis bank but common people not provide loan or this bank.
Management and Work / Customer Relationship,"Good culture and strong goals of a company that cares for thier employees. Management is strong, advance in your career.

This is a great company to get your foot in door from a banking stand point, learning the ways of the bank and dealing with customer problems is some of the few things you will experience at this bank.

customer who are not satisfied with how the bank operates and representing the bank you have to understand that not all problems can be fixed and we have to attend to the the customer in the best way possible.

"
Customer care or carefree number?,"This afternoon I have received a SMS from abc bank IT service saying I have to provide FATCA declaration for the smooth functioning of my(?) account which I don't have in the past and present and most definitely after this call made to the Toll free number regarding the same issue.

The lady had surely have an issue with the vocal and doesn't deserve to be in the customer care for this foremost reason.

Secondly she had readily have an answer by assuming the customer's complaint.

Finally she concluded the conversation after saying "" Thank you for call. Day"" and disconnected without even expected whether the person called is understood.

Sht yaar. even after so many FDI in banking sector this nonsense continue to be senseless.

Long live privatizations.

abc bank review,"abc bank or simply abc bank is a PSU bank. This is the largest bank of abcd. But as a big name abc bank the services of abc bank ( abc bank) are very poor. The employees are very cold , they behave rudely to their customers as they don't care about who you are. In many branch they make fool of you saying that this is the rule by RBI and many times they don't open saving accounts of customers.

I am really don't understand if they are for serving customers or not? Kindly improve the banking service.

Zero balance account- no issue cheque book,"In abc bank, there is government policy taking by prime minister Narendra Modi, there is open a account on zero balance. Without giving any amount to open this account. Because in several villages, there is no one can use it there own bank account anymore. But this policy will make record in the limica book of records to highest number opening account in abcd. So this is the achievement but this account not provide cheque book to their consumers. Because they have not withdrawn money from this instument. And in this account have some limits to not deposit more than 50, 000 and not maintain huge amount to this account. So there is some limitations to access this account. So government will improve these limitations that will more help to public.

abc bank,"If when you think about a bank then first abc bank comes in mind.

abc bank internet banking, ATM and mobile banking is the best thing for which we consider about abc bank. If we search internal thing or on site service then it is the worst bank than others.

The behaviour of employee in bank is not like good, they show peoples they are busy, so they not treat you well.

It's Internet banking is simple, easy to use by every people.

After an withdraw every time you got a message but it is happen on deposit.

Due to ATM service, It is used by mass of people.

"
Pathetic working staff.,"This is not always happens when you visited a bank stay there for 3 straight hours and the purpose is'nt fullfilled.

Yes, gyuz I am talking about the abc bank burari, delhi -110084 branch. This is the worst bank I have ever seen in my entire life. There is no division of labour and only one and two counters are active.

You have to stand in a very long line just for deposit , challan, or draft like works. And yes , the 80 percent staff includes perosons with disability there.

This branch is always out of account opening forms.

Just discusting conditions here. Don't open any account atleast from this particular branch.

"
Poor Management of Financial Resources,"No of branches are increasing day by day and quality of service is downgrading. Existing senior employees are not willing to work as per the requirement. ATM are not maintained. In Vapi abc bank swayam is opened since to months.since then non of machine is working.

abc bank a next trusted future,"abc bank is a progressing bank of abcd . abc bank provides various facilities and provides different services according to different yojna, so that people get all new reforms which are coming in our daily life. Ihad also open new account in abc bank and enjoy the service that provides with proper cooperation.

One of worse bank ever on this planet.,"Banking service-worse

1.my father had a pension account in this bank but they never get a respect of senior citizen I go their for him to stay in que for a long time.its because their is staf but only few of them working.they work like they are at home having tea on their chair.they without any issue raised issue many time n send my father to go table by table.

2.at that my father made some fixed deposit what ever he had from his retirement but at the time of giving back that money they made too much drama n my father run from one counter to another then at last in evening he get his money.

3.when I was in college they send me back for a education loan for one lakh rupee."

abc bank...biggest abcdn bank but shocking service,Hi.everyone here I am going to share with u my bad experience as a abc bank customer.I am from a small village and the only banking service in our locality is abc bank.But the codition of the bank is horrible.Often the funds are limited and due to this problem the farmers in our area have to suffer a lot.Apart from this the customer relationship of the bank officers are horrible with the people.There language is very rough and they dissatisfy the customers by there rude behaviour.The bank provided very low grade service and they always claim the problem is due to higher authority.I had applied for a debit card 8 months ago but till now I havent recieved it.The people who had opened jan-dhan khata have not recieved there documents and other things like pass book and debit cards.Even if there is a long queue in the bank the bank employees sit idle claiming there is a link failure.When people visit the bank for passbook updation they deny to do it giving a reason the scanner is out of order.They never accept that it is there duty to maintain everything in proper condition or get it done by complaining to the higher level.They are never serious and faithful to there duty.I dont know what is the condition of other abc bank branches but the whole loophole is about abc bank sameli branch district katihar bihar.I am not claiming that abc bank as whole bad but I am discussing about this particular branch.I hope who ever reads my review and has a bad experience about abc bank anywhere will like this.By doing this I can know the condition of other branches.
Generous abc bank,This is one of the bank who's ATM can be easily found easily any were at any were . It provides good interest rate to the account holder in their bank. Though the bank creates new schemes every time to the bank holders but the people are not able to get benefits of the bank due to less educarion about the bank. It provides loan to the people at lower rate of interest .
It is the father of all banks.,It is best bank because of it various reasons why people are loving it. It has various financial plan for all family members who are using the same bank. It has various branches at various places. It has given various job opportunity to be a good citizen.It working environment is also very good for it employees to do well in the bank.
abcd's biggest and worst bank,"abc bank is undoubtedly abcd's biggest bank in terms of revenue and market capitalization, but on the same time it is worst in terms of employee facilities, convenience and customer satisfaction.

Pros-

Branches in every small town or village

largest ATM chain

cash availability

Cons-

ATMs are in pathetic conditions

Long queue in banks, no process to handle large no. of users

long working hours for abc bank employees

Bank employees are full of anxiety

huge paper work and less work actually.

I never want to go again in abc bank as it, make me completely fed up."
One of the best Bank in abcd,"I have been using abc bank savings bank account and as well as I have multiple Fixed Deposit account with abc bank now and I am satisfied with its service.

I am also a banking student, want to join as a PO in abc bank and also some of my relatives and friends works in abc bank. I know very well the salary scale and benefits are given to the worker is good.

It is one of the best public bank in abcd and it is one of the oldest public bank in abcd and it government uses this bank very much to get in touch with common people. I think it is very good and very secure place to work.

abc bank has a lot of customers and it has a lot branches in different location and also there are many position and opportunity to grow your career confidently.

Being a very popular and well reputed bank of abcd it maintains its service and work environment very well.I visited abc bank multiple times and I experienced multiple manages and they were helpful.But the Customer care service is not good and most of the time it takes 10-20 minutes to reach they through call.

Thanks for reading my review."
Suitable bank,"Im a huge Fan of abc bank . one of the best bank in abcd . its service is very best . you open easyly an savings bank account here with zero deposite . I has also only transection mode . abc bank is the only bank , you can found it in every state , every district and every villages of abcd . transection system is very in across the banks . abc bank cheques can easely process . the atm machines of abc bank is very good working and you can found it in every corner of abcd . atms of abc bank are very reliable., fast processing for withdrawn . online transfore mode is also available in abc bank , and its easy to use .and also easy to join ."
Please don't use this credit card,"The abc bank sales executive said that there will be emi options so you can repay amount monthly and when I started using it they said its not possible to make emi option you have to pay full amount, if it was emi then its ok when we get salary we can pay it, but all amount at a time how can we pay it, it was very bad experience I was not having that huge amount so I said I can't pay it please make it emi but they dint do it after few months they started to come to my house address and tourcher to pay amount they said pay atleast 17000 now we will make it as emi so I agreed and I payed the amount they said customer care people we call you to convert as emi but after that no one called me to convert as emi instead they use to call to give the payed amount reference number, I have give the reference no so many times but again and again they use to call me and ask payment details and till no they have no converted to emi and they are adding more and more interest and they are telling me to pay that amount so this type of services if you are using you will ruin your life so plz don't use this type of credit cards, its my worst experience in my life time"
World's largest bank,My first account is in this bank.Many of abcdns will prefer abc bank account only as personal account.One of busiest bank in abcd.From april 1st 2017 every abc banks come under abc bank so it will be a biggest bank in whole world.Now a day bank account is must for every person to encouage digital transfer of money and it is easy to access account in abc bank.my favorite bank.
The largest Bank of abcd i.e abc bank.,"The abc bank is a an abcdn multinational public sector and financial service bank. it is a government owned corporation with its headquarter in mumbai. As of 2016-17, it has asset of 30.72 trillion and more than 14000 branches, including 191 foreign officer across the countries. The company is ranked 232nd on the fortune global 500 list of the world biggest corporations as of 2016.

abc bank is banking behemoth and has 20% market share in deposit and loans among abcdn commercial bank

The bank is providing many services under very heavy terms and conditions.

Car Loan , Credit Card, Saving Account, Current Account, Home loan, Gold Loan, Education Loan and etc.

As far as, The employee salary is very good in the compression of private sector bank. But the services providing by his employee is very poor.

Lastly, Every people is know the abc bank is a beggest bank of abcd and also belive on the bank but his service is needed to improve. so that abcdn take the benefit of abc bank. If the bank is not improve his services then people can move to another bank.

Bed bank of County,abc bank is top bank in abcd and bigest bank a abcd pubilc sector. But the servce is bed of county banks. This bank is many problem biget problem is the net connection . I am go to monty 5 time in bank . But 3 time is net not working . And information desk the is to reduculous . I asking any bank related questions to answer is I 'm not handing this desk contacts second preson . I am very disappointed the bank service.
abc bank- Not good Bank,"Although it is the largest commercial bank of abcd and provide many facilities but it lacks the customer service.Its customer relationship is very repulsive.Many a time staff talked very rudely.They just agitate while opening account.Also they do postponing works of normal customers.Such employees are devoted only to merchants.If any merchant wants to get loan, bank manager instantly sanctions, but any normal user wants loan, bank manager tells many rules and regulations and bypass their duty.Such prejudice behaviour is not up to the mark.Like this abc bank is not providing banking services to middle and poor people.They are just devoted to merchants only.

The employees must be trained in customer relationship approach .Moreover they refuse to provide netbanking, demat service etc.They pretend to update entries of passbook by saying that printer is disturbed. They demand for frequent KYC update even submitting documents timely. So overall it is horrible banning employees of abc bank.The government must take appropriate action against such rude employees and they must be financially punished.

Bad customer service,"The bank is faithfull but the customer care service is not good . we get no respect and late respond to our queries and needs.

In this bank any account holder can get full security of money because each work in this bank work with full security.I have an account in abc bank .Any body can open an account in this bank with full security.Now I am giving some idea on employes that is you know that this bank giving full security, so employe will also get the regular payment .And one onther thing is that abc bank in abcd is very reputed bank.

Overall an FD is stuck at Railwaypura, Ahd branch due to some hold over it from collateral of Bopal Branch. Loan is liquidated in past but not able to remove that hold and hence Branch is unable to pay. abc bank Railwaypura 7600038036 is the person knowing most about it however some steps to be performed by abc bank Bopal.

This seems to be a technical issue and number of officers tried to resolve this. However it seems that support from higher level is needed.

Subject: Re: Pending Complaints

Dear Sir,

As you may see the time of the complaint raised from the mail chain and from the details under it, Hereby I am raising this escalation according to the point no.5 mentioned in link below.

abc bank.co.in/webfiles/uploads/files/1339585079004_GRIEVANCE_REDRESSAL_POLICY_JAN_2012.pdf

I would be expecting update as mentioned in point 6.

I understood from Branch manager(Bopal) that the matter is stuck due to some technical difficulties for which they have already raised issue with technical desk. I appreciate cooperation of Mr. Anilkumar. The other branch(abc bank Railwaypura) which has the deposit and primary responsibility appeared complete non co-operative and irresponsible in this matter.

In absence of formal updates, I would like to raise priority of this matter by escalating it further to chairman as mentioned in Point 7 of the same document.

Looking forward to co-operation.

Dear Sir,

I just had a word with Mr. Anil Kumar and learned about the efforts branch people have put(both the branches) Its just that I am now learning that something is happening there and it might be technical thing which is preventing the entire process. Sincerely appreciating and my apology for harsh words. With that someone would have told us about this work.

I will not remind till Mid Jan and will get back to you if things are not resolved by that time.

Dear Sir,

Thank you for the efforts and clarity. However I fail to understand if Bopal failed to de link due to some technical reason or are not doing it /not answering at. If I see mail chain, they have not put a single response. Once my mother visited them as guided by your staff and they responded that they have not nothing to do with this.

Now, I am learning that Bopal branch has shown a casual approach. I will meet them tomorrow if possible otherwise I will escalate Bopal branch this time which will include chairman abc bank.

Can you pass me telephone number of abc bank Bopal?

Worst bank,"Earlier abc bank was very popular bank. But nowdays abc bank is becoming worst bank becuse of its system. Everyday we have to stand in crowd to deposit or withdraw our money huge people are coming . All the schemes and welfare activities payment are done through abc bank so a huge rush is there. Employees salary are so good and it is a public bank so no one worries about customer. Their behaviour is also so bad because their job is secure no one through them out.

Instead of abc bank we can open account in other banks which are giving more facilities and advantage to customers and they dont have to wait much more for any banking query."
abc bank staff are totally irresponsible,"Today I will share some bad experience of abc bank one of the the biggest bank of abcd.

Several time I have went to abc bank I have faced the same thing all staff are rudely behaving with customer.they are some time become arrogant and showing apathy towards the customer.generally they take extra 20 min after lunch for that every customer has to suffer"
Very good service and features bank..,"I've been an account holder in this bank since 3 years. I experienced worst with the workers their in our branch. No one is doing their job correctly. Most recklessness to answer the questions. They looks like they have no interest to do their job anymore. Only the compounder do his job correctly except him no one is good. especially in cash counters and banking service officers. But abc bank service is awesome with my whole experience. Only the fault is in employers only.They provide interests half-yearly for whole amount in the account and cut off fixed sms charges quarterly. Very good service.

"
Worst bank in abcd,"Plz plz if r u going to open the account in abc bank then step away.i have opened account but now I am blaming myself.they dont behave with customers well.you can see other banks how they are helpful to customers.also I am going to open my account in axis bank.and dont worry I will write a review on it.and stay tuned for more

"
Bank of every one.,"I am the accout holderof abc bank since 18 years and my experince is very good .there facilities are good. The biggest quality is there branches availibility and atm all over the world. The net banking and the mobile banking are also very good. The check clrearence in short time due to there cbs banking facilities. Some times the crowd burden disturb but its not the big issue.

"
Misbehaving staff and irresponsible staff,"Though abc bank is one of the leading bank of our nation, it doesn't have recruited good staff.to my bad luck I have my account in lingarajpuram branch, where I can see lazy and irresponsible employees.in whole Branch only 1 staff member will be performing her duty correctly, whereas others will be busy having there lunch. This branch hasn't recruited young staff who is enthusiastic in their work rather it had old ladies who is not fit to perform that job. and the way they response to customers are horrible, . Inspite of such big queues, they are 5 minutes early to their lunch and whereas coming back from their lunch takes extra 20 minutes from their break hour.this branch is simply horrible iam very much disappointed being a customer of this bank.

Coming to net banking.I can't describe the way that website has been designed.some time it will show wrong password and some time it will be excepted.that site be logged out automatically though we are using it. terrible branch I have ever experienced. thank you.

"
Sad state of affairs,"Why is it that any government-run institute is filled with lazy and unprofessional staff? abc bank is no different!

Unfortunately I have an account in the Borivali(Gorai) branch and every time I have to visit the branch office I regret my decision of opening the account here. Irrespective of the day of the week the bank is always crowded, not because it is popular but because the management is extremely slow and doesn't care about your schedule.

From submitting the KYC to cheque clearance everything is a struggle here. It has been 2 months since I applied for a new card and every time I cross check I get a standard reply that will be at my doorstep soon.

abc bank (abc bank) Review,"abc bank Saving Account Review & Rating

abc bank is a multinational banking and financial services. It is a government-owned corporation with its headquarters in Mumbai, Maharashtra. As of December 2013, it had assets of US$388 billion with Reserve Bank of abcd taking a 60% stake. In the financial year 2012-13, its revenue was INR 200, 560 Crores(US$ 36.9 billion), out of which domestic operations contributed to 95.35% of revenue. It has 16, 000 branches.

Over a period of 10 years I am holding this abc bank account. the mos interesting part its a public sector bank and I am holding an account with the said bank. IT would be great if they work on the customer service and it takes a long time for us to reach the customer service."
abc bank,"Well reputed bank, but service to customers is not so good.they took more than 15 days to simple query regarding IMPS fund transfer.

And purposefully delayed their service when it can happen just few minutes of work. Almost more than 20 Mails and Above 30 calls, and more than 10 visits to branch regadrding same problem."
Big bank but greedy employees,The bank is so big. They provide every facility to coustmers but their staff is very greedy. They don't know how to talk to customers. They know very well that your form is wrong so come after sometime otherwise do it yourself. My friend had activated his internet banking but he forgot his profile( transaction password) so he went to his branch they did not what is the use of profile password. They reset his login password. What a bank. If I talk about new age of staff. They know ver well what is job and how to communicate to customers and talk also
No service,"abc bank is abcd's biggest bank. The bank is highly reputated. But the bank staff is also feel that they are so reputated that customers are nothing to them. They may ne thinking that customers are for them, they are not for the customers. The bank is also greedy that it gives less loan compared to other bank. The service of online banking is poor. I filled two times the form of transaction rights but I still did't get it. But if you are a bank employee than you get handsome salary with good future scopes. The working environment is boring because the bank employees don't like to work or help. But still your job will be secure.

"
abc bank,"abc bank yes it is abcd, s largest bank and I think best bank in the country.Recently I opened a bank a/c with the bank and was amazed with the process of opening an account it was about half an hour, only e kyc verification and my account opened.

It consist accidental insurance also no other document required.i am very happy with the way and technology they used.it has almost 19000 braches and 50000 atm across the country.it follows latest technology to serve its customer.i like it very much.

Worst Bank in the world,"When ever the word bank come in our mind, which reflects the entire envoirment with lots of happiness, relax moods, happy happy people and having lods of good conversation. But this entire scenario will gets changed whenever you enter into any of abc bank branch. The nagativty in the envoirment is always very high. The anger and fustration is always very high with most of the customers. All most all the banks are short of staff and the banks are over crowded. As per income and jon security this bank is good but in terms of working envoirment and peace pf mind it is one of the worst place. As soon as I enter the bank I always thinks about when it will be 4 o clock. And I will out of this bank. A must no for all of you as employee and as a customer as well."

Bank like bsnl sim card,"When yesterday I went in abc bank , I realise this bank is so emotion less about any old persion and even other persion . What ever salary gives by bank to our employes dose nat matter whith refrence to the morality. Some banifits gives by the bank to our employe and customer l, some of them gold loan, car finance, home loan and so many servise . But over all job in the abc bank more secur as comlare to other bank. The bank is a only job which provided one persion to many field experience. Bank provaide great atmospher to man and woman also to give him/her best performance. But abc bank of indea nat have a good seo ."
abc bank,"abc bank is definitely one of the most sought out multi national bank enterprise and maintains good record of providing great schemes such as home loan, signature bond, car loans etc but the customer service of this bank doesn't meet its global standard. The ATM card is the most challenging task to collect since it takes like more than 2 weeks for same to come and yet their are some tedious procedure for account opening which makes you opt for other bank accounts."
abc bank.,"abc bank is a leading multinational and public sector bank in abcd. It's head quarter is situated in Mumbai, Maharashtra. abc bank biggest job providing bank in the banking sector. As comparison to other bank abc bank provides good working facility and excellent behavior with customer. Generally we may easily find the abc banking facility in almost anywhere across abcd. abc bank provides job in current time more than 29 lakh employes in entire abcd. I am itself maintaining abc bank account from last 07 years. I am tatally satisfied with abc banking system because it is provided consumer friendly and easily accessible facility to its consumer. abc bank also provided a smooth internet banking facility to its consumers.

abc bank key features: ATM and debit card facility, internet banking, mobile internet banking, Loan facility, dedicated customer care facility, secure socket layer technology to protect online information security, cheque and demand draft facilities etc.

Because of it is provided a seamless execution of transaction I would suggest every consumer should prefer the abc banking facility. After becoming the abc bank consumer it will be good experience for the consumers."
abc bank customer service very worst,"Guys Think about that if you open an account in abc bank means its big problem coming in your life. Because in my concern abc bank giving very worst service in his contact center. If you call customer care, no one can pickup your call and not giving the right information to customer regarding ATM activation. I was reapplied for my abc bank ATM, ATM has coming but its PIN is not available in bank and also bank customer says you must applied again or wait 20 to 30 days for your PIN, if you not wait than generate your PIN online or using mobile messaging. I was send message in my registered mobile number by same process printed in ATM pamphlet, but PIN is not arrived. I was sending 5 time same message but nothing has replied from the bank as well as in online process.

So I think I just withdraw my money and open an another account in other bank, like Axis, HDFC, ICICI. It gives better service to customer also your money is also safe and also gain higher amount of interest rate. So guys think about that before open an account in abc bank. Than decision is your."

Famous bank,
Don't Join credit card or loan marketing,"Few days ago in newspaper I read ad for marketing of abc bank Credit cards, I go through it and found that it was agency, They told me you will be given 3500/ month as salary and there will be bonus if I sale more than 10 card. there were no clarification that if I don't sell minimum 10 cards what will happened? I started roam whole city, day and night, sometimes didn't had lunch.


As I was student I wanted to earn as my pocket money but I spent lot on petrol for this, after month end I sold only 8 cards ( most to my relatives ), as the day come of my salary they told me that you have not completed target, I said what target? than they told it was 10 cards minimum so you will be given only Rs.750 as petrol allowance only, Believe me that 8 card was added to my senior and he got bonus but I didn't get salary even.   Do think is this right? Same thing happened in loan selling.


Please be clear at the time of joining cause they cheat all new comers and most of them are student as I was, and they have to go back home even westing their pocket money in petrol to earn for them.   And this apply to all bank credit card and loans too so beware of that
"
Unprofessional attitude!!,"A couple of days back I received a call from the abc bank call center offering to sell me a life time free credit card. She (the sales rep) was more interested in reading me the benefits than answering my questions, as if she were a cop reading me my rights.


The attitude of abc bank sales is incredible, they believe they are actually doing a favor by offering their services to customers. During the call I asked some questions regarding the billing cycle and the credit period. She told me that I have to pay my bill every month and that the credit period is 50 days, so I asked here to explain further as to how that can be if I were to pay up every month that is every 30 days?


On this the women had the audacity to tell me that I was asking too many questions and that she will ensure that I will not get an abc bank credit card in this life time!! what a joke. If this is the sales team I can only imagine what the Customer Care would be like. Their calls are not even recorded unlike many other professionally handled banks.


Take their Credit Cards at you own risk.
"
BEST EMPLOYER: TAKES CARE THROUGH OUT YOUR LIFE,"As a retired officer of the Bank, I am of the opinion, abc bank is the best employer. It is taking care of its staff even after retirement. I am enjoying the fruits of my service in the Bank even after retirement. When in Service, Bank has taken care of most of the needs of its staff. If one can plan well, one can easily achieve all goals in life be it in career or in personal life. All dreams can be fulfilled. One can own a house, car and other house hold requirements and lead a decent life. In service, one can visit various places including overseas along with family on a holiday for rest and recuperation. The Bank has its Holiday Homes in various centers across the country which can be used by its staff in service and even after retirement for a nominal fee.


One can fly or travel in AC class during travel either on official trips or on pleasure trips with certain conditions. Now after retirement the Bank is taking care of the basic medical needs of its retired staff in addition to paying pension. Even after the death of the staff, the spouse is entitled for a family pension and basic medical needs. Once in a year the Bank arranges a meet of all its staff pensioners for discussing their problems and to arrive at a solution to it.


If I am what I am today, it is only because of my employer abc bank. One should be lucky to get a job in abc bank. Entire future is taken care of. An officer who has joins the bank today with a career in mind, can become the Chairman of the Bank at a later date.

Irresponsible People in the world,"I have applied for a credit card and somebody promised me saying I would get a certain limit but as promised I didnt get the limit what they have said. Anyways I dont any problem now. but I wanted to know the reason why they have not be able to deliver , what they have committed.

Hi friend, I recently opened a saving account in abc bank which is abcd's largest bank.Since it is a government bank I always thought that it is not good.


I had my couple of accounts in private banks.After a long term I realized that these private banks are full with hidden policies nothing else.


And if you are looking for genuine and authenticated service then go with abc bank.you will find abc bank's ATM anywhere across abcd easily.


The basic amount that should me maintained within abc bank's account is very less.some account are zero balance account. I.e., no mininmum amount is required for that type of account.It provides benefit of insurance at the time of opening the account you can get loan easily with very feasible interest rate.So hurry go and open a saving account in abc bank for bright future.

The best bank,"abc bank is a very good and well known bank. It provide many different services like loans, deposits. It gives a job security to its employees for life time.


The growth level in the bank job is awesome. It gives many benifits to its employees like acomodation and gives high salary. The working environmemt is very descent and honest in the bank. Services are quick. All works are done very systemetic. Its all branches are very clean and systemetic. Must go for it.

After that some one responded us but we were very unhappy they said us that their employee is absent today so come next week. I really faced very bad experience with abc bank.

Service is poor,"Hello friends, I am sharing one of my experience with my bank and that is abc bank. I wish that it will help you in making the right decision while choosing your bank. first of all the availbility of abc bank branch is very easy, you will get branches of abc bank anywhere easily and you will also get ATM machine of abc bank easily. now come to the problems.


The working officials are lazy so that if you want that they will do your work so you have to go to them more than ten times and still there is no guaranty that your work is going to happen. if you lost your ATM card then they will make you realise that you did the biggest mistake. abc bank needs to improve in service part .
"
Need to improve in services,"Hello friends, I am writing review on abc bank and I hope that will be helpful for choosing your bank. abc bank is a great bank in terms of branch and ATM machine availability. You will get the ATM machines very easily everywhere but when it comes to the services so are going to face the problems like improper behavior by the staff.


Opening student account is one of the biggest task do in abc bank branches. One more thing I want to mention is if you lost your ATM then you have to struggle a lot for new ATM card. Internet services are just ok. I suggest that if you are thinking to open a account in abc bank then make sure that you are going to face these type of problems
"
Very bad customer services,"Although it is the biggest bank of abcd and government too. But the services of this bank are worst. I have account in hoshiarpur branch . They have very rush in there and never tried to resolve that. Many of times their fax machines and internet facilities not working. If you want to deposit any cash then you have to wait many of hours. And net banking website is many of time is under maintenance. If you post your query or contact to them they didn't respond on the time. If you want to do anything related to bank then it Gonna take time.


I have frustrated with their customer services.
"
Best Bank In abcd,"abc bank is the best bank in abcd . It is a abcdn government bank . abc bank's branch are spread all over abcd .


It's ATM counters also available at many places all over abcd . I think abc bank's ATM counters are more than all others bank .


I have open a single account few months ago . All transactions are printed on passbook in details . It is a very helpful feature to know a transaction with full details. I am also using their Internet Banking . It is very easy to use& helpful . I can check balance, transfer money to anyone with their internet banking services . They have toll free help line number . When I face any problem, I call them& they help me . They provide all type of Debit Card like Visa, Master, RuPay, Maestro as per customer requirement.


They provide free ATM transaction per month as - 3 transaction from Metropolitan City& 5 transaction from Non-metropolitan city . ATM charges is 112/- per year .Now I can done cash deposit& cash transfer by GCC . I can use my ATM card in GCC . If anyone don't have ATM card, he can request to branch to issue a Green Card . It charged 20/- one time .I can update passbook myself in updater machine . To update passbook ownself user need to request to branch for attaching a barcode in back side of passbook. abc bank's staff also behave friendly . Their all service are very friendly .So, I highly recommend this bank to all .
"
Bank employee are not friendly not willing to help,"I get to know that abc bank is listed in top 100 bank in world. But reality is exactly opposite. abc bank give so many facilities but the main problem is the bank employee they don't know how to talk . Always ready with excuses so that they don't have to work.


My personal experience with abc bank delhi cantt. Branch I try to update my passbook there is machine for updating passbook but its not working as usal . After that I tried for passbook update by waiting in long q when my no. Came machine stop working this happen to me many time bank employee saying machine is not working or server is done is the most common excuse.
"
My Personal Experience With abc bank,"I am using abc bank's service from few months ago . I have two type of experience with abc bank service .


Good Experience-


1) abc bank is best bank in abcd . I also get it is under top 100 in the world .


2) It is under government of abcd . It is fully trusted.


3) Their branches are available all over abcd . They have also many ATM counters at all places .


4) Internet Banking service is very easy to use . I can check all transaction in details .


5) Their all type of are very friendly .


Bad Experience-


1) I have a savings account in my local branch Mahisgote Branch . To open my account I submitted fully fill up account opening from attached with my KYC documents . After that I need wait 1 months to open my account . This is too much time . They loss my time .


2) Maximum time staff are unable to update passbook . They say link not available .


3) Their service manager Monoj Kumar behave roughly . He also provide me many wrong information .


4) This branch's other staffs are too slow . When I go this branch I need to wait too many time to complete my work . Evenly some time I need to wait 2 hours, to know about any enquiry or cash deposit .


5) Mobile SMS facility are active for my account . But, SMS not received for credit transaction . For this issue I went on bank, but they said they are unable to solve this problem .


6) My one relative also open a account in this branch . But, after few days when she check CIF details, it is show her CIF automatically, wrongly transferred in a other branch . As a result she is unable to got any service like ATM card, net banking, Green Card . So, as per branch request she submitted a letter to transfer her CIF in Home Branch . But, more than 1 month gone, till now it is not transferred .


Final Statement- abc bank service is very friendly, but some branches working too much badly . Their staffs are too bad . As per my many bad experience with abc bank, I can not suggest to open account in any branches of abc bank . I can suggest that, if possible before opening any account in abc bank, know about branches activities from old customers . If activities are well, can open account .

Government of abcd owned the Imperial Bank of abcd in 1955, with Reserve Bank of abcd(abcd's Central Bank) taking a 60% stake, and renamed it the abc bank. In 2008, the government took over the stake held by the Reserve Bank of abcd.

Satisfied Service Provider -abc bank,"As usual as abc bank is an a govt sector bank and my causin is also working in abc bank Chamba as post of clerk there.As I can visited the abc bank branch many time and I have also an account in the abc bank.I am usually satisfied with their service.The pay to their employees be the best and also many facilities amongst loan which can provide by this bank to their employee.


As I can came across to the services it provides all facilities to ots costumers as according to the RBI rules.I can use debit card or internet banking both facilities of abc bank and also be use Money depositing machine or swipe machines for faster and convient transaction.


Once a time I can transfer money through card to card by Atm from abc bank card to SBP account but the money cant be reached and two days will passed so I can visit the branch of abc bank and meet with a lady employee which helps me and give me a costumer care number also and also registered issue at her diary and check my account behaves very honest and politely.I can call costumer care they can be attend my issue soon and resolve it in 3 days .Costumer service is an average quality or as mixed.but some of employees are of bank are not polite in behaviour and running from customer work which should be noticeable in this gov bank .


As chosen as career then the abc bank provides the best facility to its employers not as the private sector bank but in case of salary its be a good choice.I am also efforting to crack abc bank test or IBPS exam to take a seat at better salary.abc bank no doubt in its facility but abc bank should be check employee behaviour time to time to make their bank quality better then other high profiled bank like HDFC ICICI etc. 
"
Use abc bank card,"Dear All I am using the abc bank credit card past 10 year, very usefull to me.


Good service, loan Felicity credit period is high, proper statement emailing, grace period is available, process fee no for all loan like housing loan etc, easy to operate the banking sector, safety to operate the banking with us.any where in banking, we can use the bank operation in mobile also. like cheque book request, dd taken, etc.
"
Treat humans like aliens,"""Tereko kaay ko account kholne ka hai"" this are words from abc bank employee, when I went to open saving acc for first time in abc bank, I was expecting ""AAPKO"".


I have many bank account in icici, yes bank & TJSB but there customer service is great


abc bank is a multinational banking and financial services company based in abcd. It is a government-owned corporation.


I have an savings account in abc bankn never ever seen such rude banks.nowadays all the banks are user friendly and they help a lot to the customers and treat them with proper respect.they treat humans like aliens as we r come from outer space & opening account to get desire benefit .


they dont even tell us what is the procedure to do certain things they scold people rudely in front of others and they ask us why are we coming to their banks without knowledge.


they refuses to help in every situation as there are involved in their internal works as they think they r OBAMA secretary they have lot to do & refuse to help older perople & make them wait forever beocz employee r busy in there own personal problem


I have no complaint about bank operation, Bank is great but just lack in customer service .


becoz of this I rarely visit any any abc bank branch now I prefer online transaction.

"
Staff behaviour is very rude as always ,"I am a user of abc bank for past few years and I trust this bank completely. Services are average and this bank provides many facilities for common people. I am using its services nearly for last 8 years and this bank is increasing and improving its facilities day by day.


I use abc bank Maestro debit card and as all we know bank has lots of brances in nearly all cities of abcd. Also bank has very good ATM machines all time working and very easy to find. Online services are great and very easy to access from mobile or any web browser, I found this very useful even bank provides many kinds of extra discounts or many other offers for online shopping from their debit or credit card. With all these facilities and good services I found many bad points of this bank which completely disapoints me.




private banks provide more offers and disscounts for online shopping from their debit or credit cards.





This bank does not treat customers as private banks do





Staff is no behaving properly with customers





Bank branches doesn't have enough space according to their customers and flooded with heavy rush





you have to wait for a long time in bank for your number





customer sercice centre is pathetic and calling them is equal to banging your head on wall





Interest rates are low





staff doesn't provide enough knowledge and details to customers







Overall I am not satisfied with their behaviour and dealing and private banks are ver polite and handle very decently and banks like axis bank and hdfc banks are providing amazing offers with supper fast services but yes one can call abc bank as common man's bank and good for normal usage but if you want extra offers and services go for private bank and they will definitely please you very well.
"
Behavior of abc bank's Staff is very Bad. ,"If you want to do Job at this Bank then this is good for you, Big Salary, Nice office but this bank is hell for it's Customers. Staff is behaving with Customers like they are Aliens and Staff played with customers.


abc bank(abc bank) is one of the Worst Bank in abcd. abc bank's staff very very Frustrated. They only work for Salary. abc bank is not working well because of its Staff members who have bad attitude.
"
Good bank,"abc bank is one of the good service bank of abcd.i have a savings account in my local abc bank mahisgote branch.their branches are available all over abcd and they have also many abc bank atm counters at all places.


abc bank is the best bank of abcd.i like it.


It is government bank which is too good.


Now abc bank launch abc bank freedom app.i use abc bank freedom app.bill pay, mobile recharge, money transfer and I can check all transaction in details with this app.


When I go my local abc bank branch I need to not wait too many time to complete my work .because I use green channel which through I dont wait too many time in the bank.grenn channel facility is too good.


I am using abc bank service last 1 year.bank staff are too good.good service.they are very friendly.


abc bank service is very good.my experince is too good with abc bank.i can suggest to open account in abc bank.
"
abc bank is the abcd's best bank. ,"abc bank is the largest bank in terms of customer in the world. The main reason behind to choose a employee of this bank is their environment, a good salary and the trust of having a public sector bank. The good thing about this bank is the salary comes on time, all the benefits like Medical facility, PF etc.


Bad aspect is that your promotion is always dependent on experience only no matter how well or how hard you work. I recommend everyone if you want a secure job its good, but if you want to grow your carrier its not a good company to work.
"
Good people to grow,"abc bank is the largest bank with more branches and more staff in abcd.And holding 51% share by govt and 49% by others.


abc bank proposed many schemes for house loans, education loans, business loans etc with good interest rates. Ours was one of the major sector is the banking sector .Job in abc bank is very nice and really have good benefits, I prefer who wants to do job in banking abc bank is the best choice.
"
abc bank employers,"abc bank is the biggest bank in abcd. It has largest network through all over abcd.S.b.i provides very good facilities to it's employers.


It provides better management to its customers also.But there is a large scope for betterment and it depends on top management. All the staff of s.b.i are really so decent.This field is really full of challenges and fun. S.b.i gives honour and respect to its all staffs. It increases encourage and confidence after working.
"
The Brand Itself ,"abc bank. abc bank is the biggest and the most power holding bank in abcd. And ofcourse as the title suggests is has become a brand in itself. I am a regular user and banker at abc bank and the services provided by abc bank are just fabolous.


I must say that in this date our country abcd is one of the fastest growing economy and abc bank has played a majoy role in developement of it.


Most citizens in abcd have their bank accounts in abc bank as it is the most trusted bank in abcd.


abc bank has most number of bank branches and atm and cdm machines all over the country. Almost every place has at least one abc bank atm or branch present.


It provides the best service and your hard earned money is completly safe in abc bank.


One thing I dont like or regret is that the employers at abc bank branchers may it be the cashiers or peons even the manager are not well behaved, they think themself as lords and do not respond to our questions few times.
"
abcd's largest Savings and current account bank,"abc bank or abc bank is a big and largest public sector bank it is applicated by RBI/ Reserve Bank of abcd.


The facility of this Bank is very good compared to other banks like netbanking debit card credit card one of the most important service of abc bank is green channel facility in which we don't have need in a line that we can directly deposit by the help of our debit card swipe debit card and we can easily deposit withdrawal and transfer money out any line I always use green channel of the abc bank.
"
Quite Bad experience,"I want to share my worst experience with abc bank.


I am a customer of abc bank since 2014, and had a very worst experience.when I filled an online application for opening account, the clerk has told me to deposit at least one thousand rupees else my account won't be open. I showed him a Web page of abc bank regarding opening of account then he given my passbook on deposit of Rs.200


And now I received an sms regarding balance deduction of Rs.114 for sms services. I reached out to abc bank branch Malegaon and asked clerk for reason, the clerk is not responding me first, then after waiting sometime he talked with me in Marathi language which I can't understand. and finally ignored me and I feel very bad. These clerks are graduate but instead of talking in hindi or English they are communicating in marathi language which cannot be understood by some peoples. Further they are not talking politely untill you looking so handsome businesses man with lots of money in your pocket.


abc bank should train their staff to give better services.


My problem is not solved due to the Bad personnel of abc bank.

Even I cross checked with my post man who usually deliveres in my area regarding my abc bank card. I went to bank and enquired about My card and shockingly they said it's been dispatched and came back as you are not there. Then again I applied on bank to dispatch , waited for 2 months and still no luck. When ever I visited bank I'll here sone or other issues. Even when I go to deposite also they are asking atm card and it's really getting worst day by day. Last I tried with online banking and this is also same I got user name and password and that should be updated I'm my records it seems. So need to check my luck on coming weekend.

Regarding our national bank abc bank,"His this is Anand. abc bank this bank service is not bad , but lots of advantage and disadvantages too. But 1st we need safety and secure , in that it stands 1st as my opinion. After earning small money we need to be kelp safe and secure. And disadvantages online frauds, but it's is least one.


And we need branches in abcd we have everywhere, we can deposit and we can take money through ATM .  But service it takes very slow but standared, don't compare with private banks, because it's nationalise.so have be patience.
"
abc bank advantage,"abc bank is good bank where u seems that no one can fraud easily because of long process in offline and they take ur signature in front of you


2) about their internet banking which is most secured ssl128 bit encyptid you can 100% safe when you are you are using this service but bevare from pishing and fraud lottery mail which are from hackers and spammers
"
Many Outdated ATMs,"I've used ATMs from several banks across the country. So far, the best connectivity was provided by abc bank atm. With 10, 000 it is the bank with most ATMs.


However, my complain is not with the reach of the ATMs, it is with the machine at few of the older ATMs.


The machine looks very outdated when compared to the ATMs of HDFC and other giants. There have been several occasions when the Rs.100 denominations was not available which caused a lot of inconvenience. I think abc bank needs to upgrade few of their outdated machines now. It will help save time of the ATM user.
"
First class banking co.,"I worked at abc bank full-time(More than 10 years).Best customer service. Good attention to the borrowers as well as depositors also.Making pass book entries takes a long time sometimes in some branches.


Bar code stickers are not available in many branches which causes the customers to go to home branches for pass book entries.great learning experience about financing multiple business, great relationship management experience, job security, good work life balance, good leave policy, low workload.high accountability, slow decision making, bureaucracy, transfers at regular interval, slow promotion and job growth.Low exit opportunities .Monotonous after working for few years.Lowprospect for interdepartmental change.Better appraisal and promotion policy.


Besides bread and butter, abc bank was an identity for me and I feel proud of to be employee of the esteemed institution.Nowadays, I sees downward trend of the institution and am worried about the institution to whom the old employes have given blood. Sorry to point out point out, but I have many reasons and constrained on the issues which I saw in the near past, Recent policies of the bank are cause of this decline. Real banking is in doll drums and cheating with the customers, presently.Range of work helps you to learn different things, well defined processes, one of the best amongst PSUs.THIS bank provide all the best facilty whatever we want. but yaa some atm machine is outdated which are not working properly.

Bank with no care for customer and worst managemen ,"I have opened an account in abc bank of abcd here in delhi branch, but right from then I am regretting that why I even thought of Opening an bank account in abc bank. Right from beginning they were making the process of opening an account in their bank so tough that its like you are trying to win a court case and that too in high court. Employee of abc bank are so rude to talk that you even thought of that they even attended some school or college.


If they are under pressure or workload is there they start screaming on their client. I also wonder how these banks are working because after initial experience I never thought of visiting that bank again. This kind of experience I had in there. Local bank officials have made their own rules and regulation which they force on customers. I complaint regarding this to higher authorities then they did some work and were cordial but after sometime they are same. Kindly improve services.

Atm is always empty without having money. The demand draft require near about completely 1 day. The service provided to folks is the worst. The financial institution people behavior is very bad. They act like villian in the bank. The bank require more part network, more member, more salary, more updated software, fast internet connection, more electronic supply, more people for working. State Standard bank of abcd is the perhaps the most famous and trusted Bank in abcd.


It gives Personal bank as well as business banking. Offers various types of loans to their customers. Offers World banking and NRI consumer banking too. Though it is trusted bank the only problem is getting a locker there as it asks a huge amount as deposit for opening locker room.

The Imperial Bank of abcd (abc bank),"Hello friends, every body know about abc bank and how big this organisation is. abc bank is the biggest branch in abcd having 16333 branches across abcd. Its head office is situated in Mumbai and abc bank is popular among lower middle as well as higher class of peoples. It was established in 1806 and it becomes the oldest commercial bank in abcd.


We all know the history geography of this big bank. But some things are very bad about this. The employees behavior is very informal. Customer's has to wait hours for just one single work. If we went here for some enquirers then they even don't have time to give proper response.Even the loan procedure is very tricky here. They don't give loan to needy peoples.


We all know that abc bank is abcd's leading bank but I think for customer support and services it is the worst bank, specially the employees, those who work in abc bank as an employee feels that they are very unique peoples in this world and rest of all are nothing. They don't respect the importance of time for other.


I want to clear one thing here is that this my personal experience and my intention is not to hurt any person.


People across abcd believes in abc bank and most of the lower and middle class families have there account in this bank. Even I have an account in this bank and I feel safe that my money is in safe hands. But some times I feel so frustrated when I visit to this bank just because of the behavior of employee.

abc bank Best Bank With Only One Problem,"In abcd almost everyone has their account in this bank, me too.And I like it so much because of their services and very generous customer support and the every now and then published new apps.


But I am here to address one issue which every abcdn is familiar with this Bank which is arrogant bankers.We are their customers, they are there to serve us not scare us.


My recent encounter was when I my mobile banking app was not working they were constantly sending me from counter to counter at last the guy who was supposed to solve that problem was not even there. That was so exhausting that I gave up.


But I still love this bank the rate of their progress is extraordinary cash deposit machines or book printing machines they are installing them every where. That makes up for their Crappy Employes.

abc bank,"Months back I went to open an account for my sister and the attendant failed to open an account, he was skilled enough to do that and asked for additional documents. This a very sad customer experience.


Today again when I went to the same branch after verifying the documents branch manager told that a student who doesn't have any account has been blacklisted and they can't open the account.


This not acceptable, have skilled employees to deal with public.


Later when I went to different bank in ten mins account was open and money transfered.


Branch manager of safdarjung branch does have any idea of how its works. Very very bad customer experience.

Worst Bank in my Life,"abc bank opened its branch in my town and started its operations 3 years back.


I wanted to open an account in the bank so I visited the branch and they always said to come on another day to even give an account opening form.


I came and went to the bank almost seven times to get my account pass book finally.And the main problem with the bank is the bank started a mini branch facility it is like a business correspondent and that is meant to be used when we dont have time to go to the branch itself and they should not collect any extra chargea from us according to the rules but they are charging 30 rupees for a transaction of 500 and 59 rupees for transaction above 1000. The bank completely stopped accepting deposits in the branch and telling us to deposit at the business correspondent only.What kind of wastw bank is this.

Best bank,I have account in abc bank since last 7 years and I must say abc bank is really very good.till now I have never faced any problems from this bank.like my refunds for any cancelled orders usually comes to me within the stipulated time.they also provide a high rate of interest on the savings account as compared to other banks and very recently they have also started many programs of investment like TDR etc.so I think its a quite reliable bank and its really good from all aspects.
RELIABLE BANK,"I have an account in abc bank since past 7 years and I have received a very good service from them.i have a fixed deposit in this bank and they provide very good interest rates on it.i also have a abc bank debit and credit card which I often use for shopping online and other purposes., .they give good reward points on the credit card too.and overall the service in the abc bank is also very organised, staff are very good and helpful.overall I can rely on abc bank completely."
abc bank,abc bank is have many branches but I do not credit of any other abc bank branch The cleark beahviour is very roudly And no print passbook to timely also excuse machine is not working Automatic machine is not proper working Banking staff is very slow to work 
Poor handling customers,The employees of abc bank are not very friendly. The employees are always frustrated and wont help if we need any help.people refer to security guards instead of cashiers and other employees who are supposed to help.they are taking their jobs lightly and therefore the reputation of the banks 
Overseas Funding problem,Overall s b I abc bank is one of the largest and most trustable bank of abcd even though it lacks in dealing with overseas payment. I am having some online dollars payment and I cannot use abc bank atm to validate that. It is so irritating. Also abc bank is one of the most busy bank
Good bank in abcd.,"abc bank is a very big bank in our nation ,


But sometimes it sucks.the ceo is bad,


Its customer service is average, not better than UBI,


abc bank offers u good loans, opportunities.but still I dont think its very best in its service!


Day by day it is going down, because of some maybe poor services, they close the bank very early compared to others.


PNB, UBI, ALLAHABAD, SBH is better than this .

abc bank is a very big business Bank,"abc bank is a very big business Bank in abcd other than nationalized Banks.


It has given many facilities to the Employees like big Salary, low interest on loan for the departmental employee.


LTC facilities is better other than Government department, this bank gives cash payment on LTC, employees status are maintained by the bank like children education, house rent and other allowances etc.


After superannuation the department gives pension, if any employee wants to take Voluntary Retirement from Service, they will be entitled for lump-sum payment at a time. abc bank is have many branches in abcd and also out of abcd. The clerk behavior is very rudely and working of staff is very slow to work.

Not upto mark service,I am a customer of abc bank since last three years. The service of abc bank is not all satisfactory. When ever you want to do a transaction you have to go to the branch where your account is exist rather you will charged minimum 50 rupees. abc bank has introduce Greene channel for first transaction but now you have to stand in a Que for make a transaction in green channel. The staffs of abc bank are not so familiar with customer like other bank. If you are making good transactions in private banks or small psu banks they will sanction many types of loan to you according to your requirement but at abc bank it is not possible for all. abc bank has the largest ATM network nut most of the ATMs are out of order or shortage of 100 rupees note.
abc bank,abc bank is one of the best public sector bank in abcd. I have opened ac and its working very nicely. I got atm on time. Net banking services also very good. I am very satisfied with the services which they have giving. But it has very crowd in branches and less staffs. 
Lack of staff,There is always a huge rush present in bank. Their staff cant handle their customers. They neglect and avoid their customers. There is no proper management in bank. You have to wait at least a hour to deposit or withdrawl money. Staff behaves rudly with their customers. 
Not good at all,"Their services are not that much good as a private bank gives. Management of their team is also bad. They dont give proper care of their customers.When I go there I see A long Line on cash counters, And this is very annoying. Please improve the system. otherwise this bank will lose its customers.Even its debit card is not supported by paypal and google wallet. while axis bank,hdfc, Icici debit cards are supported by all those services. You may get abc bank every where, but believe me their services are not that good. If you have Rs 5000 then go for HDFC becoz there services are good. and their cars are accepted buy all."
Best Public Sector Bank,"I am Customer of abc bank, I have 2 Bank account in abc bank. abc bank is one of the Public sector Bank in abcd, I Recommended it. abc bank gives to All Customer Home Loan, Student Loan, Car Loan, ATM Card, Net Banking, Credit/Debit Cards etc. I use many times abc bank ATM Card for Instant Money. abc bank Net Banking Service is Good and Secure Transaction also.

I went to my nearest abc bank branch to take education loan, but they tell me that it is a small branch, we can't pass education loan, you have to go your city branch, then I went to city branch of abc bank, they said me that your area is not under our branch, you have to bring a reference letter from your nearest branch that they can't pass education loan, only after that we can discuss about it . when I go to my nearest abc bank branch to ask about the reference letter, they completely refuse me to give reference letter and move me from here to there and no processing about laon has yet done. in my opinion the loan processing unit of abc bank is totally disgusting. so I requested to the students who want education loan to complete their study, please do not go to abc bank otherwise you feel disgusting."

"
Best in PUBLIC SECTOR,"Hi friends, in this review I am sharing my experience with the banking services of abc bank, which is the largest public sector bank in our country ( abcd) . Well this bank being the largest caters to the largest number of citizens of our country. The facilities provided by the bank are very wide range like CURRENT ACCOUNTS TS, SAVINGS ACCOUNTS, LOANS, INTERNET BANKING, MOBILE BANKING etc. These are only few services of many provided by this bank.


Apart from this being a public sector bank it has the largest network of branches and ATM's. You can find this bank even in villages also. With the facility of CORE BANKING you can operate your account from any of the branch in any place of the country.


The interest on loans are also very low, which will enable the banks to provide loans to even low income and middle class families.


The only thing I found which I would like to be improved is the communication style of employees of the bank with their customer. They often DON'T TREAT THEM IN A SATISFIED MANNER, since you always find rush in this bank it will also be challenging for the employees to cater the customer at the earliest. Now the GOVERNMENT IS ALSO INCREASING THE NUMBER OF STAFFS which will solve the problem in near future.


Overall I can say that it is really a GOOD BANK in the public sector and I recommend you people that you can try its services if you want without any serious concerns.
"
No good bank,This ia bank is no good no like is bank. My accaunt is 5 yers My atm card used to get blocked after evry 1 month and I have to visit the branch to make a request and again the long proces abc bank name is good Service is no good. abc bank 
Bank staffs very bad behavior,In Gurgaon few months ago I was in the bank for my new account open and all staff are saying that they don't have time. Second thing they said u can't open a account less then 25000k.it was worst experience for me and my elder brother. Staff this behavior is very shitty. Please improve your service and staff counseling
abc bank..changeing future,All I want to say is that abi is really is one of the most strongest pillar of our abcdn economy.we all abcdns should be proud of such a bank which is secure .Now talking about the jobs I want to say is that that working in abc bank ensures job satisfaction and safety with a handsome salary thus I advise you all to try for abc bank job
Good But Not Best,"I have savings account in abc bank from last 3 years. abc bank have the largest branch in all over the in abcd. So if I decided to open my savings account in abc bank only.


The good thing in abc bank is that you will get at least on e ATM in every place. So this is biggest advantage you have with abc bank. The systems are fast, internet banking is very easy to understand. The features of abc bank card is also good, security is good. Another thing is that they will never call you for credit cards or any short of insurances which other private banks are doing. So over all abc bank is good.


The bad things are its customer care service. If you revoke your internet password then in bank branch only you can rest it. If you are far away from your home then it will be a big problem. Reset password is the biggest problem in abc bank what I faced till now.


As per my recommendation everyone should have at least one account in abc bank but at the time we should have another account in any other bank as well for net banking. If you have good brain, if can remember every thing then the abc bank is enough.

BAD SERVICES,"I am always facing poor experiences with abc bank. I have open account before five years. Its services are worst either you going in their branches of talking with costumer cares.


You never give a satisfactory answer from their side.


Few months before I submitted a cheque to the bank. A mam was handling my cheque. She is manager of that branch. Firstly she said their is a problem of ink. The name and the amount was written in different ink. I gave her reason the she said sign was not matched.


I took the cheque and submit in my other private bank account.


See their was no issue of pen ink or signature match and my cheque was cleared with in two day.


I thin the government bank employee do not want to work.

Very poor service,"abc bank is the worst bank in todays banking sector. it is only opened to harash people.it has many unnecessary norms and requirements when some visit this this bank for any kind of deposit or withdrawal.one I went there for depositing some amount into party's account it asked to present my green card.i was not knowing wat's that green card.but after few arguments I came to know that without that green card I can't deposit money not even in some one's else account but also in my account.its just a nonsense thing which bank introduced to harash people.kindly donot open an account with abc bank.thank you.

Third class bank,"The abc bank is a good bank, but it is only good with it's name, otherwise it is a fully disgusting bank of abcd. If seriously study about all banks and rank them, than abc bank comes last of the row, it's running because of it is a government owned bank, otherwise nothing. The staff are think they are prohibited, and behave like a judge, their discussion are full n final. In this bank no one expect good service.yeh bank kebal naamse chalta hai"
Some times abc bank fails,"I have been working at abc bank full-time ( More than 8 years)


Pros


1) A simple graduate can't get a better salary anywhere else in the country


2) If joined as a PO, 2 years of training can actually make you learn a lot about the entire banking verticle


3) Easy on women eomplyees


Cons


1) With a high salary package, the bank might rope you in, but after a while, you will understand that there isnt any value addition


2) Its a typical govt bank. Dont expect anything fair or right. Its a total anarchy here. People dont believe in ideas, they believe in age old rules


3) No feed back mechanism from employees. You can just act as an anonymous whistle-blower or otherwise management has full rights t?

Very poor services..............,"Dear friends, write now I share my today experience of visit of abc bank, and today I decide to close my account from this bank .i have very dissapointed from this bank services, there no response of staff in branch, I think staff get salary at free of cost. there is too much compliance is taken by us for a single updation of data.


I wait very long time to reach the counter for get service, there is heavy crowd in the branch because of staff, staff take long time to their work completion .


speed of work of staff is very bad .

Share market,"The price of abc bank is between 251 and 254 and is stable. As the news has came that all banks will get merge. Aftr the merger the price of abc bank will touch the sky. Near about 350 0r 400 Rs.

"
Why one choose abc bank as a career,"As an employee of this bank I would prefer this to make a career in abc bank. The career starts After joining the bank from the entry level. If a candidate joins abc bank as a clerk then after 3 years he gets promoted to JMG-1 / ASST manager. A recruited Probationary Officer gets promoted to scale-2 after 3 years of service. Besides that every employee of abc bank gets better salary, perks and other facilities compare to other psbs."
Very poor service,"abc bank is a government bank and the service is as expected very poor!


Starting from beginning I went to saltlake branch to open an account but the representative talked as if he was very pissed off. Somehow I managed and opened an account. Now if had some work at the bank there are 4 counters of which 1 is almost empty everytime which means there are only 3 people sitting at counters. Then most of the times they work so slow, talk among themselves and waste customers time!


One day during lunch time 2 counters were closed for lunch break and after there break time was over they were still not back on their seat the third one also went and there were no representive at desk. We were skipping our lunch for work and they were least bothered!


Now I wanted to change my branch so went at the respective persons desk and she was also so ignorent speaking so rudely! I really do not want to be associated with abc bank anymore.


Not there service nor their representives are worth it! I do not receive messages for my transactions and when complained they blame our telephone network which is very illogical! Their interest rates are also not so good! Other banks would be a better option I guess!

Great bank.,Hello friends today I talk about abc bank ( abc bank) . its a huge bank in abcd and the best thing is that it has branches every where. its services are also available every where. I am customer of abc bank since last 7 years. abc bank has many schemes according to the status of the people. as people feel comfort he can open his account in this bank. its a trusted bank.
Evey staff of abc bank think they R prime minister,"abc bank ( abc bank) is one of the top four Bank in abcd. abc bank's head office is in kolcata. abc bank has more then 1800O branches in abcd. We can see branches of abc bank in even small villages. We can esely find many ATMs in about all places. abc bank provides Saving, Current, Fix deposit, Loan, Investments, Insurance services to his customers. abc bank has good rate of interest and many excellent schemes for their customers.


Every thing is good of abc bank but I don't know why abc bank's employees think they are CEO of abc bank or Prime minister of abcd. They treat with us like a teacher. I had closed my saving and Fix deposit only because of it. I am telling not about only one branches staff but also all branches staffs are like this. I know you ( Bank Staffs) have Gov. job but it doesn't mean that You will do as you like. They takes many time for singale transaction. In working time they will be left their sheet many time. If any uneducated people go this Bank for any transaction they do not help to these people's. These people would have to face lots of problems in abc bank. Very rearly we can see any good staff in abc bank. I was went abc bank for a draft. They take 5 hours for my draft. Would you believe this. If abc bank staffs will not change their attitude then slowly slowly abc bank will loss their customers.


I don't recommend to any people for opening any accounts in this Bank. I only want to say.abc bank is very excellent Bank but their staffs have attitude. If you have lots of time or If you would handle staffs attitude then I think you should go to this Bank. If I leave employees matter then abc bank is one of the very best Bank in abcd.

Poor management,abc bank is most trusted banking in abcd.They give many schem for fixed deposits and other account.But in a bank the most important role is custamer satisfaction.They faild to keep the custamers bcz the important problm is their behaving is very poor.If u want a loan urgently they want many documents than other banks.And their Internet banking is not work properly.
Most Secure Bank In abcd,"Everyone wants to be a part of this most secure bank in abcd.


I am also an abc bank customer and very happy with all its facilities.


The good aspects of this bank are they provides full security on online transaction, Net banking facility is too fast, Mobile app is fantastic and ATM are available almost everywhere.


Bad aspects of this bank are it account opening criteria which is too big and offline service at abc bank branch which is time consuming.


I would strongly recommend to have an account in this fantastic and most secure bank.


My experience with this bank is superb as they started online facility to open abc bank account so that customer can easily fill their details online at their home.

The best abcdn bank,abc bank is peoples 1st choice. It is mine also. I havnt faced any problem with the working process of this bank. Hassale free transactions can be expected by any individual. And you can do many big national transactions with its cards. I have seen in many sites that only 5 or 4 banks they prefer and abc bank comes on the top. On my experience 2 years banking relationship with this bank I can say that this bank is very reliable and the processess does not take much time. The interest rates are decent too and their staffs are very helpful.
abc bank,"abc bank is one of the most famous bank and old reknow bank s i.love this bank.all my family has account in this bank .They give many facility and many types of loan.But the employ here r not so good nor to bad , but I feel there r too strict and not at all friendly so people feel bit uneasy.apart of that it is very good bank and very big too .the ambience of the bank also is very good the rule here r also good .we even can do foreign transaction easy , it have very fast tranfering of money .all over its very good bank and very useful and easy bank .thanks for reading my review about this bank"
Brief people views about the abc bank,"Hello I want to review something about abc bank .as we all know that it is one of the leading banks in abcd but employees of the this bank are not behaving properly with customers compare to other banks . it has brought so many apps and these are used by some people but not all the people I mean they are not directly beneficial to comman people.there is no much flexibility in this bank some times we have to wait long time for our work and I am not saying every employ is like that but most of workers will not behave properly . So according to me this has to be changed apartfrom this it has good name in the view of people .

Yar mera number kab ayaga,First of all this bank has has a atm almost all the places in abcd and the principle are also good but there are many factor which I don't like about this bank.first comes the queue of people for even a simple work I don't know one thing about this bank this bank has branches all the abcd where human being can reach easily but they do not have a staff to control the croud of public and the staff which they apponint are aged person which do there work where slowly. And some time they sow attitude to so I opened a another account in axis bank it is much better than this
Good bank to open ur account,"I choose this particular bank because I noticed that compare to other banks in abcd this particular bank is most trusted bank. So I never thought twice to select this bank over other banks. This bank has their services and branches all over the abcd and every corner of the country. Also it has a good service. The only negative part that I witnessed that the particular bank has too many formalities so it is sometimes very much problematic to the customers.

"
Quick S.B.I home lones,"abc bank Home Loan is much sought after, thanks to its competitive interest rates and impressive turnaround times. The interest rates are as low as 9.35% . The Loan process is see-through and quick. Good repayment tenure that extends up to 30 years, makes paying back your Home Loan as easy as pie. You can take a Home Loan from abc bank even if you are 18 years old, provided you earn Rs.30, 000 per month.


Most reviewers of the abc bank Home Loan were happy with the schemes provided. Most customers were delighted with the interest rate for the Loan.

The ATM network of abc bank is abcd's largest ATM Network.


Its Net banking facility is really good. good connectivity with frequent transitions.Its mostly service is good like visa money transfer, mutual funds purchase, demat section, bill payment, demand draft request etc.


The problem with abc bank is that its worker unhelpful attitude and carelessness of employers like other govt department. I noticed many times if the money machine is damage than it will take 2 or 3 month to correct it and I have to spent 1 hour for money entry in my passbook.

Trust for abcdns ......,"abc bank s the most trust worthy bank compared with other banks but we as a public should be more patient with them, compared to other banks banking is time consuming even when we walk in to branch it is very crowded. you will be irritated but I suggest if you stay in abcd you should have one saving account with abc bank.


abc bank is the government recognized bank and they are good but not feeling happy in regards to their net banking. If I want to transact amount on online then I have to register the mobile number and I did that but still I could not use that as it is asking to register the number. Though I submitted my complaint one year ago, it is not yet been resolved. For amount deposit abc bank is charging 50 to 100. However satisfied in holding savings account.

NOT SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICE,"I have my account in abc bank and I want to share my experience with this bank which has not been nice at all.


Each time I go for depositing money I have to wait so much for my turn to come. Some employees in the bank do not work at required speed which the customer need.


If you want to go easy with the banking , better not to open an account in this bank.

Good environment to work with ethic,"There is heavy work load particularly in the traditional areas where employees are expected to work without sufficient staff strength.The abc bank is like a joint family having a healthy atmosphere among all the co workers which has lead to the heights of bank.As a banker, we have to deal with the customers on a day to day basis, have to understand their needs and problems and have to come out with a solution for them."
"abc bank it should be ""Slow Bank of abcd""","Employees of abc bank are never ready to work. They take 3 hours for making a single demand draft and if they dont feel like to make it they always hv an excuse that "" system is not workin maam"". always ask for account in abc bank.they are like "" pahle account khulwao iss branch me"". are yaar ek dd k liye account khulwana padega kya.lol. they charge for demand draft according to their will some branches take 40 rs. for 500rs dd n some branches take 90 something for the same amount."
Other banks can't do cheat like abc bank,abc bank has done what the banks of whole world can't do I make online purchases and transactions with my abc bank debit card but yesterday I noticed that id my account with rs.17 in every 2 or 3 days when I enquired about it icame to know to onow abc bank has been charging for every online transaction that failed due to lack of website server I tried to transact for rs. 200 with suffiecient balance in my abc bank acc.

Good banking services by abc bank,"abc bank is abcds largest bank and has about millions of costumers even though it is trying to provide better servuces, every possible street has an abc bank atm, abc bank has a cash deposit machine in its main branches across city which makes e banking very fast, my experience was good in internet banking, and mobile banking, though the people who love traditional banking have to face long ques for withdrawal of deposit in their branches, even if the services are good they have a lot of load on them, but I do like abc bank because it is reaching almost every possible corner of abcd.

A decent Bank to Bank with,"abc bank is a good bank. I have this bank near to my house and it is not a very big branch. Sometimes it stays crowded. The worst part are the employers of this bank. They think themselves to be the prime minister of abcd. Purposely they go slow in calculating money etc etc. Some of the bank staffs dont even know how to use the keyboard. They typse so slow that the person in the queue starts getting frustated

Its a nasty experience,"When ever you come in to any branch of abc bank of abcd you are insulted by the employs. Their language is so poor that you feel that the employs are doing some favour to you by doing your work. In all other private banks, the customer is treated in a gentle manner. But here you are treated like a beggar. The only reason this bank is still functional is that it has low interest rates for loans."
